                            <br>
                        <p><strong>SQL Server</strong> is a relational database technology developed by Microsoft.</p>
                        <p><strong>Transact-SQL</strong> (T-SQL) is an extension of SQL that is used in SQL Server. Transact-SQL is closely integrated into the SQL language, yet it adds programming constructs that are not native to SQL.</p>
                        <p>Our tutorial will start with the basics of SQL Server such as how to retrieve and manipulate data. Then we will move to the more advanced topics such as how to create tables, logins, users, functions, and procedures. We will conclude with a review of the functions that are proprietary to Transact-SQL.</p>
                        <p>With this tutorial, you should be on your way to becoming proficient in SQL Server and Transact-SQL.</p>
